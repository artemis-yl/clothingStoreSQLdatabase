### Final Project / Assignment 2 for CCPS510 Database Systems I

Final Due Date: Saturday December 6th, 2025

Students: Artemis, Kyron, Theebika

Professor: Ersan Cam

System and Language: Oracle SQL Developer v8

### Files

1) SQL scripts for table creation, data insertion, and sample queries
2) PDF of our presentation slides
3) Normalization diagrams
4) Final ERD Diagram

We also had a final report, but I will not include that here.

### Highlight of Design Decisions

**Scope:**

### Other Notes

Overall, I worked on this for ~10 hours with most of my time spent on the report and the presentation slides, ~6-7 hours. The ERD design and actual SQL code (I created the table creation and edited/add more to the data insertion) took ~3-4 hours.


### Potential Future Work

Professor mentioned that sometimes this is a project converting an SQL database into a MongoDB database. I may attempt to do so.
